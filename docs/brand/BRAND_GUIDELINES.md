# Stella Brand Guidelines — the Charlie system

Stella's identity is **Charlie, the astronaut pup**: a golden retriever in a
space helmet, drawn in warm cosmic sunset color on deep space plum. The star
(stella) he's chasing sits in the wordmark and on his helmet glass.

Every asset in this directory is **generated** — edit
[`build.mjs`](build.mjs) and re-run it; never hand-edit the SVGs or PNGs:

```sh
node docs/brand/build.mjs            # full build (SVG + PNG, needs rsvg-convert)
node docs/brand/build.mjs --svg-only # fast iteration
```

## The marks

**Charlie** — his head inside the helmet: a nebula-gradient ring with a
collar base and visor shine, golden coat, cream muzzle, caramel floppy ears,
a gold antenna bead, and a four-point gold star drifting across the glass.
On light grounds the helmet interior stays deep-space plum — a porthole into
space. In the mono variants the star is punched *through* the helmet ring as
a knockout at 1:30.

**Star mark** — the dogless compact logo: the wordmark's four-point star
enlarged in the nebula gradient with a small gold companion. Use it (or the
wordmark alone) wherever the illustrated pup is too playful.

## Variants — every family ships six

| Suffix | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `-adaptive.svg` | Full-color; flips light↔dark automatically via `prefers-color-scheme`. Default for docs/web embeds. |
| `-light.svg` / `-dark.svg` | Non-adaptive color variants for grounds you control. |
| `-mono-light.svg` / `-mono-dark.svg` | Single-color line art (ink / milk) for engraving, embossing, single-color print, disabled states. |
| `-mono-adaptive.svg` | Mono line art that flips ink↔milk with the OS theme. |

Adaptive SVGs carry both concrete presentation attributes (the light state)
and a `<style>` block whose `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` rules
override them. Rasterizers that ignore CSS (librsvg) therefore render the
light state — **PNGs are only cut from the non-adaptive variants**, into
`png/` mirroring the SVG tree, always with transparent backgrounds (except
app icons, splash screens, wallpapers and the nebula wash, which own their
grounds and ship light/dark only).

| `legacy/` | Retired systems: ember-gold (2025) and `aurora/` (cyan-on-navy, retired 2026-07). |

## Palette — warm cosmic sunset

No ice blue anywhere. The signature **nebula gradient** runs
`corona → flare → orchid` at 135°.

| Token | Hex | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `corona` | `#FF6D4D` | Coral orange — gradient start, energy accents. |
| `flare` | `#F5487F` | Warm pink — gradient middle. |
| `orchid` | `#A24BEA` | Violet — gradient end, interactive accents. |
| `starlight` | `#FFC24D` | Gold — stars, the antenna bead, highlights. |
| `caramel` | `#DE8F55` | Charlie's ears. |
| `fur` | `#F2BD79` | Charlie's golden coat. |
| `muzzle` | `#F9EDDC` | Charlie's muzzle and chest. |
| `ink` | `#2A1A35` | Warm plum-black — text/line art on light grounds. |
| `milk` | `#FFF6E9` | Warm white — text/line art on dark grounds. |

### Grounds

| Token | Hex | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `void900` | `#0E0916` | Dark mode — deepest ground. |
| `void800` | `#171021` | Dark mode — base ground. |
| `void700` | `#241833` | Dark mode — raised surfaces, helmet interior. |
| `cream50` | `#FFFAF0` | Light mode — highest ground. |
| `cream100` | `#F9F0E1` | Light mode — base ground. |
| `cream200` | `#EFE2CC` | Light mode — sunken surfaces. |

## Typography

No webfonts required for product surfaces (system-native stacks stay), but
the wordmark itself is drawn geometry — monoline rounded strokes, not a font.

- **Sans:** `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Inter, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Mono (code, terminal):** `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", monospace`

## Usage rules

- Clear space around the mark: at least the helmet-ring stroke width (7/120
  of mark height) on all sides.
- Don't recolor Charlie, tilt him more than the wallpapers' −6°, or separate
  the gold star from the wordmark.
- Poses are illustrations for empty states, onboarding, and marketing — the
  head mark stays the identity mark.
- Mono variants are for single-color contexts only — never use them where
  color is available.
- The nebula gradient is for the helmet ring, progress fills, and hero
  washes — not body text.

## Scope note

This directory is the brand source of truth. Product surfaces (TUI theme,
docs site CSS, Observatory, `stella-docs/public/brand/` copies) still carry
the aurora palette and migrate in follow-up changes; until then
`stella-tui/src/theme.rs` remains authoritative for the TUI, including its
regression test pinning the *2025 ember* hexes (none of which this palette
reuses).
