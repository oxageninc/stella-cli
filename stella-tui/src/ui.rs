//! Ephemeral interaction state and the pure key→action mapping.
//!
//! [`UiState`] holds everything that is *not* derived from the event log:
//! scroll anchors, the composer buffer, panel focus, the selected file, and
//! the shell-local "already answered this scope card" guard. Because none of
//! it is reconstructible from — nor should it be — the event stream, it lives
//! here and never in [`crate::model::SessionModel`] (the L-T1 boundary).
//!
//! [`handle_key`] is a **pure function** of `(key, model, &mut ui)` returning
//! a [`ShellAction`]. All of the REPL's decision logic lives here, unit-tested
//! against synthetic `KeyEvent`s, so [`crate::shell`] can be a nearly
//! logic-free event loop (it just forwards actions to the channels and
//! redraws).
